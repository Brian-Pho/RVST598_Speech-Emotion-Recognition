# Progress Timeline

---

## Preparation

- [x] Define the research problem/question
- [x] Setup dev environment and tools
- [ ] Literature review
- [x] Find databases

## Main Work

- [ ] Read in data from each database
- [x] Combine the different databases
- [x] Preprocess the data
- [x] Create the ML model
- [x] Train the ML model
- [ ] Modify the model to improve accuracy
- [ ] Complete experimentation

## Completion

- [ ] Write paper
- [ ] Create presentation
- [ ] Submit to conference

## Future work / Improvements

- Emotion style transfer using cycle-GANs
- Make emotion labeling not mutually exclusive
- Use phase data from STFT
- Fuse spectrograms with raw waveform using 1D CNN
- Combine with some RNN
- Use MFCC
- Use neuroscience based approach

## TODO

- [x] Move normalization steps into frequency domain
- [x] Convert from normal frequency domain into mel-scaled
- [x] Save normalized, mel-scaled, freq domain samples
- [x] Split samples into train/valid/test
- [ ] Calculate human baseline for emotion classification for IEMOCAP
- [ ] Read in IEMOCAP
- [ ] Update model to handle multi-label classification
