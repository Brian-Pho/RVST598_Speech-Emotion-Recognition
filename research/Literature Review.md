# Literature Review

## Metanotes on how to conduct a literature review

- Define the central research question
- Decide the scope of the review
- Use the bibliographies and references of research studies you find to locate others.

## Ten simple rules for structuring papers

- When you write, you should constantly have your reader in mind.

### Principles (rules 1-4)

#### Rule 1: Focus your paper on one central contribution, which you communicate in the title

- It doesn't pay to be greedy.
- The title is the ultimate refinement of the paper's contribution.

#### Rule 2: Write for flesh-and-blood human beings who do not know your work

- Try to think through the paper like a naive reader.

#### Rule 3: Stick to the context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme

- This structure reduces the chances that the reader will wonder "why was I told that?" (missing context) or "so what?" (missing conclusion).
- Putting content first may generate skepticism since they might be missing an important piece of context that makes the claim more credible.
- The C-C-C scheme defines the structure of the paper on multiple scales.
- Related to the statement-explanation-example (S-E-E).

#### Rule 4: Optimize your logical flow by avoiding zig-zag and using parallelism

- Only the central idea of the paper should be touched upon multiple times.
- Parallelism makes it easier to read the text because the reader is familiar with the structure.

### Components (rules 5-8)

#### Rule 5: Tell a complete story in the abstract

- For most readers, the abstract is the only part of the paper that will be read.
- The abstract should contain each of the C-C-C elements.
- The context must get across the gap that the paper will fill and is narrowed until it lands on the open question.
- The content describes the novel method or approach used to fill the gap/question.
- The conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.
- There's often a second conclusion relating the results to the broader field.
- The most common abstract mistake: talking about results before the reader is ready to understand them.

#### Rule 6: Get across why the paper matters in the introduction

- The introduction highlights the gap that exists in current knowledge or methods, and why it is important.
- The structure of each Introduction paragraph (except the last) serves the goal of developing the gap.
- This gap-focused structure makes it easy for experienced readers to evaluate the potential importance of a paper â€“ they just need to assess the importance of the claimed gap.
- The last paragraph of the introduction is special in that it compactly summarizes the results, which fills the gap you just established.
- This differs from the abstract because no context is presented.

#### Rule 7: Communicate the results as a sequence of statements, supported by figures, that connect logically to support the central contribution

- The results section should convince the reader that the central claim is supported by data and by logic.

#### Rule 8: Discuss how the gap was filled, the limitations of the interpretation,  and the relevance to the field

- The discussion should explain how the results have filled the gap, provides caveats to the interpretation, and describes how the paper advances the field.
- The discussion is also a good place to look for future experiments.
- The first discussion paragraph is special in that it generally summarizes the important findings from the results section.

### Process (rules 9-10)

#### Rule 9: Allocate time where it matters: Title, abstract, figures, and outlining

- Most people only care about the title, abstract, and figures.
- Make an outline to efficiently plan the text and the time we spend on each section.
- We like to write one informal sentence for each planned paragraph.

#### Rule 10: Get feedback to reduce, reuse, and recycle the story

- Writing can be considered an optimization problem and it's important to not get too attached to one's writing.
- In many cases, it's better to trash an entire paragraph and rewrite it than to incrementally edit it.
